# Development and Contribution to Dash

We encourage contributions to this project! We follow a fairly standard forking workflow for open source projects. This document provides some information about getting your environment set up.

In general, the requirements to contribute to this project are as follows:

- A [Go 1.12](https://golang.org/dl/) enviornment
- A kubernetes cluster like [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

## Running Tests

There is some automated test coverage in the libraries. You can run all tests with:

```
make test
```

## Cutting Releases

We use the [github-release](https://github.com/aktau/github-release) utility to automate creating releases of our project. In order to cut a release, a repository admin must first generate a [GitHub API token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). Then run the following:

```
# Create a new tag for the release
git tag -a <version> -m "Release <version>"
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...
go get github.com/aktau/github-release
make release
```
